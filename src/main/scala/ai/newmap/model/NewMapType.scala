/* Note on maps:
 *
 * A map is essentially a function or key-value store, and there are 3 levels:
 * - The first (BasicMap) is a map where each key-value pair needs to be specified directly.
 *   BasicMap has the distinction of always being finite!
 * - The second is a simple function, which can be coded but it's likely to be executed quickly
 *   (In other words, the coding set is not turing complete and infinite loops are avoided.
 *    we can thus execute simple functions without too much worry about compute time
 * - The third is the full function - which has a full coding set to turn an input into an output
 *
 * Note that a map can be used as a simple function and a full function,
 *  and a simple function can be used as a full function.
 *
 * The completeness field also has several options:
 * - requireAllFields tells us that we are required to specify an output for
 *   all potential inputs. It's smart to turn this on to ensure that functions and maps are checked as complete
 * - commandOutput means that the output types must all be command types, which means they start at an initial value.
